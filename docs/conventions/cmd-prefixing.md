# CMD Prefixing

CMD Prefixing is essentially offsetting your `CustomModelData` by some extremely large number. This is to avoid overlapping cmd's.

```{admonition} Example
:class: note

I have a cool sword texture I want to apply to the diamond sword model, instead of using `CustomModelData` 1, I would use `CustomModelData` 4250001
```
