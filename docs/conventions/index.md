# Conventions
Smithed imposes conventions for pack creators to follow allowing for a compatible pack ecosystem. Many of these conventions are required for packs to be submitted to the Smithed ecosystem. They allow for pack interoperability both within and without the ecosystem (i.e. they are designed to work in normal worlds).

Many of these ideas were curated and refined from the Minecraft Datapack Discord Server. The current set of conventions were completely created from scratch from the learnings of this project.
