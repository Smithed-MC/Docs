# Vanilla Overrides
{{ convention_header }}

One rough edge of compatibility between data packs are the vanilla namespaced resources. The default game's biomes, loot tables, advancements â€” these are difficult to override as other packs might clash causing a loss of behavior. We have solved this problem by integrating a custom merging solution into [**Weld**](weld).

**Weld** is a tool to help merge data and resource packs in an efficient manner. Similar to how the game automatically merges tag files, **Weld** allows you to define extra metadata to define how you would like your JSON-type files to merge. This allows you to define an override which is **compatible** with other weld-enabled packs!

```{note}
The goal of Weld is to preserve the original author's intent with their modification/creation of the file being merged. 
```

## Metadata
Smithed metadata is stored within the `__smithed__` element of the JSON file. Here, you can define how you want to **inject** your data into the vanilla resource. This is done through a set of rules which are defined in the `rules` element. 

```{note}
Any extra fields, such as the `__smithed__` field, will be ignored by the game when loaded. This allows you to define a *valid* loot table file while also being able to customize is when `weld` is used on your pack.
```

```{code-block} json
:caption: Here is a simple example of us appending a new pool that drops iron ingots
{
  // Fields from `minecraft:blocks/dirt`
  "__smithed__": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "type": "append",
        "target": "pools",
        "source": {
          "value": {
            "rolls": 1,
            "bonus_rolls": 0,
            "entries": [
              {
                "type": "minecraft:item",
                "name": "minecraft:iron_ingot"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```{note}
We use comments in our `json` blocks here but they will **not** work in-game.
```

Here, we define a list of rules which apply multiple adjustments to the loot table. In this example, we define an `append` rule which targets the original `pools` field and appends a new entry defined by the `source` field. This will result in a loot table with a new pool that will drop an iron ingot.

It's pretty common to define your intended resource in the vanilla namespace, then use the `__smithed__` rule to define how you want to merge into the vanilla resource when welded. This allows you to have the intended behavior if your pack is used without `weld`, a really important feature.

## Examples

::::{dropdown} The simplest usage: appending into `pools`

The most common use case of welding for the purposes of this convention is appending a new pool or entry into a vanilla loot table. This example adds a pool that drops `iron_nugget`s into the zombie loot table.

::::{dropdown} Merging into an empty loot table

There might be times where you might be working with an empty resource file where you are adding your own data. In this case, `weld` will dynamically create the *expected* object within the JSON as you target it. For example, appending into a non-existant `pools` field will dynamically create an array.

An example of this behavior can be seen from GM4's bat grenades where add bat leather and gunpowder to bats, a mob that has an empty loot table by default.

```{admonition} Fun Fact

Both GM4's bat grenades and TCC add a rabbit hide equivalent to this loot table!
