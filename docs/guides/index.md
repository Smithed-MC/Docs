# Guides

As a community, we've developed a treasure trove of techniques that has empowered our pack making abilities. This page will serve as a growing collection of these techniques, hopefully encompassing them as they grow and change over time. If you have any suggestions, reach out to the team via our [Discord](https://smithed.dev/discord) or even make a pull request to our [Github](https://github.com/SmithedMC/Docs).
