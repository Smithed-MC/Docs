# Usage
Every 10 ticks (0.5 seconds), hostile mobs that attack villagers are added to the `smithed.prevent_aggression` team.
Entities with the `smithed.entity` tag are ignored, but can be added to the team with a separate command.  
All mobs that naturally attack villagers are added to the team by default:  
* zombie
* husk
* drowned
* zombie_villager
* pillager
* ravager
* vindicator
* evoker
* vex
* illusioner  
## Preventing Aggression
Mobs that should not be tracked or damaged by hostile mobs should be added to the same team.
This library is made specifically so technical villagers are not attacked by mobs.
Other mobs can be added to the team, but there is no guarantee that it won't be attacked by hostile mobs.
Adding the team can be done upon summoning the mob or afterwards.
### Example Usage
`function: example:summon_mobs`
```mcfunction
# summon custom villager that isn't tracked by hostiles
summon villager ~ ~ ~ {
  Team: "smithed.prevent_aggression", 
  Tags: ["my_custom_mob"]
}
# summon custom zombie that respects the aggression rule
# by default, a mob with the smithed.entity tag doesn't get added to the team, but it can be done manually
summon zombie ~ ~ ~ {
  Tags: ["smithed.entity", "my_custom_zombie"],
  Team: "smithed.prevent_aggression"
}
```
This is the recommended way to create a villager that isn't tracked by hostiles.

---  
`function: example:protect_village`
```{code-block} mcfunction
:force:
# make villagers safe while nearby a guardian player
tag @e[type=villager] remove protected
execute
  at @a[tag=guardian]
  run tag @e[type=villager,tag=!smithed.entity,distance=..32] add protected
team join smithed.prevent_aggression @e[type=villager,tag=protected,team=!smithed.prevent_aggression]
team leave smithed.prevent_aggression @e[type=villager,tag=!protected,team=smithed.prevent_aggression]

# loop this function every second
schedule function example:protect_village 20t replace
```
This use case is not the intended use of this library, but it is a possible option shown to demonstrate adding the team to pre-existing mobs.
